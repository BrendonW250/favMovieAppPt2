# My Favorite Movies

Everyone has a set of movies that whenever someone mentions them or they get played on TV
they grab a seat and watch it like it's their first time watching it. Well that's how I feel
about these movies

# How It's Made: 
Tech Used: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Express, Mongodb

My learning was focused on using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to interact with a database
that I created on the backend. All that including displaying to the user my current favorite movies that
hit the big screen with the ability to add more to the list in the future.

# Optimizations:
When I update this project, I would think about mobile devices first when I add something like poster images
for each movie so it won't be just text that is displayed when you search for a movie

# Lessons Learned:
A lesson I learned was to make sure that my project file on heroku contains my database information or else when I add
changes to my project that involves my database they won't be displayed.
